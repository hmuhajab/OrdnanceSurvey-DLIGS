# Data Mapping for Ordnance Survey Integration into DLIGS

## Project Description

This repository contains the Python script `DataMapping.py` which is designed to process and map Ordnance Survey data for integration into the DLIGS (Data-Linked-Geo-Spatial) system. This script facilitates the transformation of geospatial data into a structured format that complies with the DLIGS specifications.

## Features

- Data extraction from Ordnance Survey sources.
- Transformation of data into RDF format using Common Core Ontologies.
- Loading and mapping the data into the DLIGS model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Additional Python packages: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `rdflib`.
  
  Install these packages using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas geopandas rdflib
